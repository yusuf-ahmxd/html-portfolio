<h1>About Me</h1>

  Hello! I'm Yusuf Habashy, a driven and versatile professional with a unique
blend of creative and technical talents.

  I'm currently pursuing a degree in
Intelligent Systems and Mechatronics Engineering at the American University of
Sharjah (AUS), where I am part of the inaugural cohort for this cutting-edge
program. Choosing a brand-new major reflects my enthusiasm for embracing
challenges, taking calculated risks, and staying ahead of the curve in emerging
technologies.

  Alongside my engineering studies, I am an experienced model with a
growing portfolio across diverse brands and campaigns. My modeling work includes
high-profile projects such as the Ramadan campaign for Hollister, advertisements
for Crocs, shoots with Tanjim Squad and Bridgestone, and a dynamic project at
the Dubai Autodrome. I've also collaborated with renowned photographers like
Widnomad and Slava Mir to create visually striking, engaging content.

  My engineering background has strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving
skills, and attention to detail, Qualities I bring to both the technical and
creative sides of my work. Whether working on innovative mechatronics solutions
or representing brands in front of the camera, I'm passionate about delivering
excellence and making an impact. I am always eager to connect with
forward-thinking collaborators, explore freelance opportunities, and continue
expanding my skill set in both technology and media.
